Ingredients:

3 ripe avocados
1 small red onion, finely diced
2-3 cloves garlic, minced
1-2 jalapeño peppers, finely minced (adjust to your desired spiciness)
2 ripe tomatoes, diced
Juice of 2 limes
1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
Optional: 1-2 teaspoons hot sauce or Sriracha (adjust to taste)
Instructions:

Cut the avocados in half and remove the pits. Scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl.

Mash the avocado with a fork or potato masher until you achieve your desired level of smoothness. Some people like it chunky, while others prefer it creamy.

Add the finely diced red onion, minced garlic, and minced jalapeño peppers to the mashed avocado.

Squeeze the juice of two limes into the mixture and stir well to combine. The lime juice not only adds flavor but also helps prevent the avocados from browning.

Gently fold in the diced tomatoes and chopped cilantro.

Season the guacamole with ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Start with a pinch of each and adjust to your taste. If you want it spicier, you can also add hot sauce or Sriracha at this point.

Taste the guacamole and make any necessary adjustments to the seasonings or spiciness.

Cover the guacamole with plastic wrap, making sure the wrap touches the surface of the guacamole to prevent it from oxidizing and turning brown.

Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.

Serve your spicy guacamole with tortilla chips, tacos, nachos, or as a condiment for your favorite Mexican dishes.

Enjoy your homemade spicy guacamole! Adjust the level of spice to suit your preferences, and don't forget to have some refreshing beverages on hand to cool down your taste buds if it turns out extra spicy."""
